# CICIDS-2018-Intrution-Detection

## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting network intrusions using the CICIDS-2018 dataset.
The goal is to classify network traffic as normal or malicious using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
CICIDS-2018 dataset by Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity.

Due to large file size, the dataset is not uploaded.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## ML Approach
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handling class imbalance
- Feature selection
- Model training (Logistic Regression / Random Forest / XGBoost if used)
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

## Results
The trained model successfully detected network intrusions with strong classification performance.

## Future Improvements
